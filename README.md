# 🤖 Multi-Agent Workflow Automator

> **Offline AI Automation Framework** built using **Ollama** and **Streamlit**, where multiple local AI agents (Researcher, Writer, Reviewer) collaborate to generate complete, polished content — without any external API calls.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how you can **automate an entire workflow**, not just a single task — from research to writing and review — using local Large Language Models (LLMs) via **Ollama**.

### 🧩 Workflow
1. **Researcher Agent** – Generates concise, factual insights about a topic.  
2. **Writer Agent** – Expands those insights into a 400-word structured article.  
3. **Reviewer Agent** – Polishes the article for grammar, clarity, and tone.  

Each step runs automatically and sequentially inside your local environment.

- Real-time agent logs and results
- Download button for the final article (`.txt`)
- Custom corporate theme (blue & white)
